I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in control theory and control engineering with the State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA). 



## Research Interest
My major reasearch interests lies in robotic manipulation, which includes intelligent assembly, contact-righ manipulation, and reinforcement learning. I received B.E. from Wuhan university of Technology in mechanical engineering (with honor).
